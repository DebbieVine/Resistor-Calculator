# Resistor-Calculator
Just a Python code to calculate the ohms of the resistor needed for a circuit as well as the band colors. 
This is a python terminal program that will calculate the size resistor that is needed in a circuit and generate the colors of the bands on the resistor for easier identification.  
It does this from a few text inputs: using the incomming voltage from thr power supply, wheither this is for an LED or not (as it was initially created to find the right resistor for a single LED or a string)
if it is for an LED it will ask if it is for a string, if so it will ask how many (at this point I only set it up for a max of 5), it will then ask for the colors of the LED's.  
The code is a bit long and could probably be condensed down some, but this was my first python program that I wrote form scratch with no refrences.
